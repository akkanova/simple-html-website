    <h1>Video Games: Past and Present</h1>

    <h2>What are games</h2>
    <p>
        A game is a structured type of play usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes
        used as an educational tool. Many games are also considered to be work (such as professional
        players of spectator sports or video games) or art (such as games involving an artistic layout
        such as mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many types of games; popular formats include board games, video games, online
        games, and card games. Games can be played in a variety of circumstances, and some can be
        played even without any materials or company. Games can be played either for enjoyment or
        for competition; they can be played alone or in teams; they can be played offline or online.
    </p>
    <p>
        All games must have a challenge and a structure; barring certain exceptions like sandbox
        games, all games also have an objective. Multiplayer games also include interaction between
        two or more players. Not all forms of play are considered games; toys and puzzles, for
        instance, are not games, as they do not have a structure.
